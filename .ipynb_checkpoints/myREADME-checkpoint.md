## Problem Statement

## Data Background

Our study uses data from the Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office \(via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) \) "used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010", which contains housing prices and house/property characteristics.  These characteristics are studied and used to create a model that can be used to predict the prices of other homes in the area.

## Primary Findings

- Top (individual) factors correlated with saleprice appear to be: overall_qual, exter_qual, gr_liv_area, kitchen_qual, garage_area.<br><br>
It stands to reason that for a person hoping to increase their home sale value, these would be the areas of focus.

- Top higher-order (3rd degree polynomial) factors correlated with saleprice are listed in the table below

## Comments/Instructions for Graders

- All data processing, EDA, and modeling are contained in the same notebook: 'dw-final.ipynb'.  The input and contest files are processed differently by the code depending on whether the run_type variable at the top is set to a 1 or non-1 value.

- Cleaned datasets as well as the original source data files utilized can be found in the './datasets' directory 

- Model-generated output filescan be found in the './output' directory
